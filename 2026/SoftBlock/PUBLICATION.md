# SoftBlock (v3) — Publication Status

## Current manuscript
- Draft PDF: `softblock/paper_v3/paper_v3.pdf`

## Status
- Stage: draft manuscript recovered; code/results not yet reconstructed in this workspace

## Claimed contribution (v3)
- Transferable soft segmentation blocks for overlapping coarse-to-fine complex recovery, with consolidation via reranking + diversity-aware selection.

## Target venues (suggested)
- Bioinformatics / computational biology venues; possibly a methods-focused venue if transferability story is strong.

## Readiness checklist
- [ ] v3 code reconstructed and runnable from `softblock/paper_v3/src/`
- [ ] v3 results reproduced into `softblock/paper_v3/results/`
- [ ] Data sources + licensing recorded in `softblock/paper_v3/`
- [ ] Manuscript source format decided (PDF-only vs source-controlled)
